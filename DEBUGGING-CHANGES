added debugFn to publisher constructor
in publisher constructor, if its undefined it sets t to console.log (but I had to set this somewhere else, so it doesnt quite seem to work?

in setReader, a new arg is added to the call to ReaderClass (i.e. standalone) to accept debugFn. is this necessary?

in publisher, because we dont have a command line argument parser, I had to force debug to true at the end of processCommandLine

in the test, I seem confused about where to pass my arguments, since
I've now diplicasted the debug flag but its not clear to what end this
has been - why I am documenting the changes here.
I cant pass settings to publishCmdLine because otherwise it skips essential processing in processCommandLine

Reader altered to accept a third structured argument in order to set 'debug' and ''debugFn' on the reader.
Reader also passes these into Parser

Statemachine constructor takes an additional 'debugFn' arg (already had debug arg)
it also sets debugFn to console.log if unset
in restructuredtext.js is where the statemachine is instantiated, so it supplied 'this.debugFn'. debug is supplied from document.reporter.debugFlag, so it makes sense for reporter to be more involved in debugging
